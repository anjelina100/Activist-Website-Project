    <h1>Where Are The Women In Tech?</h1>

    <p id="main text"> When the average person thinks of a job in tech, they think of a man. Google has released their stats of emploment, saying that 83% of their technical employees were men, so it's not a far fetched idea of men instead of women come to mind when thinking of technical job. Although the diversity of our tech field is lacking significantly, there is still time to change that. In order to change that though, we need to understand why there is a gender gap. My goal is to help you figure out the "why", and then make all the difference you can make to minimize the gender gap! Everything counts.

          <p class="subtitle"><strong>With the few women that are in tech, they are not treated nearly the same as men in tech. Even if a woman and a man have the exact same job at the exact same company, their paychecks will not be the same, and the way they're treated in their workplace will not be the same. This picture perfectly demonstrates the pay gap in the tech field, as the man has more money than the woman, yet they look almost identical, the only thing different about them, is that one is a man, and one is a woman.</strong></p>

          <p class="subtitle"><strong>In this picture, some of the reasons most women do not have jobs in the technical field, are demonstrated to the viewer. Notice how the biggest percentage falls within education. If you're wondering why most women are not in tech, take a closer look at the education system. As young women grow up, they attend high school and college, where they take classes that shape themselves to be prepared for their future carrers. Although, the options advertised to young women for future careers are not in the tech field, so how are they supposed to know about all the wonderful opportunities waiting for them in tech? Because of this, women are deprived of the same opportunities that were highly advertised to boys in high school and college.  </strong></p>

          <p class="subtitle"><strong>For those who may be a little hesitant to actually believe there is a gender gap in the tech industry, this picture was meant for you. This picture accurately represents how many women are actually working in tech. This picture shows that about 1 in 4 people with technical jobs are women, which comes down to 25% of people in tech are women. Though this is unacceptable and disappointing, it is not surprising. Because of all the reasons women have disadvantages to working in tech (as shown in the wheel graph picture), its to no one’s surprise that only 25% of employees in tech are women. But, it doesn’t have to always be like this. There is still time for everyone to do what they can to minimize the gender gap in the tech field! </strong></p>
