      Hi!! My name is Anjelina Jasso and here's a little bit about me! :) I am a rising junior in highschool that recently fell in love with coding because of the wonderful Girls Who Code SIP program! I've made this website in that program exactly, with the hope of spreading the ugency of closing the gender gap in the tech industry. The reason I've chosen to advocate for women in tech is because I believe that if we don't level out the playing field by giving young women the same chances as young men, we can never expect for change in any way. Luckily, I have a wonderful older sister who showed me all the opportunities I have for myself in tech that no one else would have shown me if it weren't for her. With her support, I've gotten into some amazing tech programs for young women of color like myself, which has given me the opportunity to create this website to hopefully shed some light on the opputitnites awaiting every other young woman out there!
